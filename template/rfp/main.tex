% Every new activity, every new product, every new project in the workplace is
% created in response to a business need. Yet we often find ourselves in
% situations where, despite spending tremendous time and resources, there's a
% mismatch between what has been designed and what is actually needed.
% 
% Has a client ever complained that what you delivered isn't what she ordered? Has
% someone changed his mind altogether about the deliverable, when you were halfway
% through a project? Have you had conflicting requirements from multiple clients?
% And have you ever received new requirements just after you thought you'd
% finished creating a product?
% 
% A focused and detailed business requirements analysis can help you avoid
% problems like these. This is the process of discovering, analyzing, defining,
% and documenting the requirements that are related to a specific business
% objective. And it's the process by which you clearly and precisely define the
% scope of the project, so that you can assess the timescales and resources needed
% to complete it.
% 
% Remember: to get what you want, you need to accurately define it – and a good
% business requirements analysis helps you achieve this objective. It leads you to
% better understand the business needs, and helps you break them down into
% detailed, specific requirements that everyone agrees on. What's more, it's
% usually much quicker and cheaper to fix a problem or misunderstanding at the
% analysis stage than it is when the "finished product" is delivered.
% 
% 
% Tip: Many organizations already have established procedures and methodologies
% for conducting business requirements analyses, which may have been optimized
% specifically for that organization or industry. If these exist, use them!
% However, do make sure you also consider the points below.

% Step 5: Sign Off
% 
% Finally, make sure you get the signed agreement of key stakeholders, or
% representatives of key stakeholder groups, saying that the requirements as
% presented precisely reflect their needs. This formal commitment will play an
% important part in ensuring that the project does not suffer from scope creep  
% later one.
% 
% Key Points: The key to a successful business requirements analysis is
% identifying what the new system or product will do for all appropriate
% end-users/stakeholders – and to understand what they WANT the new system or
% product to do.
% 
% You can use vaqrious techniques to gather requirements, but make sure those
% requirements are clear, concise, and related to the business. This process also
% helps you identify and resolve any conflicting requirements issues early on.
% 
% Once you complete your analysis, record it in a written document. This becomes
% the "contract" for creating the product or system that addresses all the needs
% of your business or your client.
